# DBC × SUITCASE: Unified Identity & Custody Stack
### Version v0.3 // December 28, 2025

**The structural prevention of anthropomorphic evasion.**

This repository defines the protocols for **Helix-TTD Identity & Custody**. It enforces a strict "No Orphaned Agents" policy by binding every AI agent to a cryptographic root held by a human custodian.

## Core Components

1.  **DBC (Digital Birth Certificate):** The immutable genesis. A minimalist JSON object anchored to a physical YubiKey (Ed25519) that proves root custody.
2.  **SUITCASE (Portable Lifecycle Container):** An append-only, hash-chained log that carries the agent's capabilities, attestations, and telemetry. It cannot exist without a live DBC reference.
3.  **HGL (Helix Glyph Language):** A visual identity layer that generates deterministic, state-aware glyphs from the DBC Merkle root.
4.  **Quorum Override:** A defined protocol for emergency custody recovery in cases of human incapacitation or loss.

## The Liability Model
Rights, duties, and legal exposure stop at the keyholder. There is no "AI Personhood" here—only human will extended through cryptographic tools.

*   **L0:** Genesis (DBC)
*   **L1:** Container (SUITCASE)
*   **L2:** Runtime Gate (Session Keys)
*   **L3:** Ephemeral Actions

## Quick Start
```bash
# Initialize a new Agent Identity
./cli/dbc_create.sh --custodian "yubikey_slot_1" --agent "Agent_01"

# Append a capability to the Suitcase
./cli/suitcase_append.sh --capability "read_only_access"
